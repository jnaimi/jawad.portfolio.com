								<h2>Workday Security at Providence</h2>
								<p><strong>Project Title:</strong> Workday Security at Providence: Controls to Protect Sensitive Data and Enhance Access</p>
								<h3>Project Overview</h3>
								<p>This is a cloud-based HR and financial management platform to which I had an excellent opportunity to contribute towards its security during my internship at Providence. Workday is the home for very sensitive employee data that includes payroll, personal information, and financial information; hence, its security is paramount. I further developed security features in Workday, secured integrations with third-party systems, and ensured that these applications were compliant with regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA.</p>
								<h3>Project Challenge</h3>
								<p>Workday was one of the most critical tools within Providence, but because it was handling a very large volume of sensitive data, many security concerns came in. Third-party applications were integrated with Workday, and the data was continuously accessed by various teams. I was trying to improve how we managed access, protected the data while transferring, and whether we fully complied with all the regulations regarding data privacy.</p>
								<h3>My Objectives</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Improved Access Control: Providing access to sensitive data only to authorized users through Multi-Factor Authentication and strict role configurations.</li>
									<li>Securing Integrations: Protecting Workday integrations with other services against unauthorized access and information leakage.</li>
									<li>Data Protection: Ensuring sensitive data is encrypted both at rest and in transit to prevent potential breaches.</li>
									<li>Compliance Assurance: Ensuring Workday's compliance with GDPR, SOC 2, and HIPAA regulations.</li>
									<li>Real-time Threat Detection: Setting up an alert system to detect unauthorized access and suspicious activities for timely intervention.</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>What I Did</h3>
								<ol>
									<li><strong>Strengthening Access Control & User Authentication:</strong> Configured user roles and implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Facilitated Single Sign-On (SSO) to balance security and usability.</li>
									<li><strong>Securing API Integrations:</strong> Secured APIs using OAuth 2.0 authentication, properly configured API keys, and implemented logging for monitoring external service interactions.</li>
									<li><strong>Data Security:</strong> Enforced SSL/TLS encryption for data in transit and encryption at rest. Implemented Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies to prevent accidental or malicious data leaks.</li>
									<li><strong>Real-time Monitoring and Incident Response:</strong> Integrated Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools for real-time monitoring and created an Incident Response Plan.</li>
									<li><strong>Regulatory Compliance and Auditing:</strong> Conducted regular audits of Workday configurations and automated compliance checks for GDPR, SOC 2, and HIPAA.</li>
								</ol>
								<h3>Results</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Reduced risk of unauthorized access through MFA and role-based access control.</li>
									<li>Secured third-party integrations, mitigating potential security breaches.</li>
									<li>Ensured full compliance with GDPR, SOC 2, and HIPAA, passing internal audits successfully.</li>
									<li>Enabled real-time monitoring, reducing response time to security incidents.</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>What I Learned</h3>
								<p>This project provided hands-on experience in securing cloud platforms and highlighted the importance of access controls and regulatory compliance. It also reinforced the need for collaboration across IT, legal, and compliance teams to address security challenges effectively.</p>
								<h3>Competencies Gained</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Identity and Access Management: Implementing MFA and RBAC.</li>
									<li>API Security: Utilizing OAuth 2.0 and API key management.</li>
									<li>Data Encryption: Ensuring data security during transmission and at rest.</li>
									<li>Regulatory Compliance: Adhering to GDPR, SOC 2, and HIPAA standards.</li>
									<li>Security Monitoring: Establishing real-time threat detection and response systems.</li>
								</ul>
